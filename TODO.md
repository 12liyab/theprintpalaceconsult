# Mobile View Enhancement Plan

## Objective
Enhance the mobile responsiveness and professional appearance of the project across all key pages.

## Target Pages
- src/pages/Index.tsx
- src/pages/Clients.tsx
- src/pages/About.tsx
- src/pages/Products.tsx
- src/pages/About.tsx
- src/pages/Pricing.tsx
- src/pages/FAQ.tsx
- src/pages/Help.tsx
- src/pages/Blog.tsx
- src/pages/Guidelines.tsx
- src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.tsx
- src/pages/TermsOfService.tsx

## Key Areas of Improvement
- Adjust padding and margins for smaller screens
- Optimize font sizes for readability on mobile devices
- Ensure buttons and clickable elements have adequate size and spacing
- Stack grid layouts vertically on small screens for better flow
- Optimize image sizes and alignment for mobile
- Improve navigation and interactive elements for touch usability

## Implementation Steps
1. Review current responsive classes and identify gaps
2. Update Tailwind CSS classes to improve mobile layout and spacing
3. Test each page on mobile viewport sizes (e.g., 320px to 768px width)
4. Iterate based on testing feedback

## Testing
- Perform thorough testing on mobile devices or emulators
- Verify all interactive elements are accessible and usable
- Ensure visual consistency and professional appearance

## Next Steps
- Start with Index.tsx and Clients.tsx for initial improvements
- Proceed to About.tsx and Products.tsx
- Continue with remaining pages as needed
